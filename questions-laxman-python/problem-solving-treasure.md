title: Build the Treasure Hunt System
---

# Problem Statement

You are tasked with building a treasure hunt management system for a local adventure game. Participants in the game must follow a series of hints and complete tasks to discover treasures hidden in various locations. Your task is to implement the core functionality of the system.

The system must manage the following:
1. **Clue Chains**: Each treasure has a chain of clues associated with it. Clues must be revealed one at a time, in the correct order, as participants progress.
2. **Participant Progress**: The system must track each participantâ€™s current progress and ensure they cannot skip any clues.
3. **Treasure Discovery**: When a participant solves the final clue in the chain, they discover the treasure.

You must implement the following functions:

### Function Signatures
```python
def add_treasure(treasure_name: str, clues: list[str]) -> None:
    pass

def reveal_clue(participant: str, treasure_name: str) -> str:
    pass

def solve_clue(participant: str, treasure_name: str) -> str:
    pass

def participant_summary(participant: str) -> dict:
    pass
```

### Function Descriptions
- `add_treasure(treasure_name: str, clues: list[str])`: Adds a treasure and its chain of clues to the system.
- `reveal_clue(participant: str, treasure_name: str) -> str`: Reveals the next clue for a participant attempting a specific treasure. If all clues are solved, returns a message indicating the treasure has already been discovered.
- `solve_clue(participant: str, treasure_name: str) -> str`: Marks the current clue as solved for the participant and prepares the next clue. If it is the final clue, marks the treasure as discovered.
- `participant_summary(participant: str) -> dict`: Returns a summary of all treasures attempted by the participant, including their progress and whether each treasure has been discovered.

### Example
```python
add_treasure("Golden Crown", ["Find the key", "Unlock the chest", "Retrieve the crown"])
add_treasure("Emerald Gem", ["Solve the riddle", "Navigate the maze", "Find the emerald"])

reveal_clue("Alice", "Golden Crown")  # Output: "Find the key"
solve_clue("Alice", "Golden Crown")   # Output: "Clue solved. Next clue: Unlock the chest"
solve_clue("Alice", "Golden Crown")   # Output: "Clue solved. Next clue: Retrieve the crown"
solve_clue("Alice", "Golden Crown")   # Output: "Congratulations! You discovered the Golden Crown."
participant_summary("Alice")           # Output: {"Golden Crown": {"progress": 3, "discovered": True}}
```

        if progress >= len(self.treasures[treasure_name]):

            return f"Congratulations! You discovered the {treasure_name}."
        return f"Clue solved. Next clue: {self.treasures[treasure_name][progress]}"

    def participant_summary(self, participant: str) -> dict:
        if participant not in self.participants:
            return {}

        summary = {}
        for treasure, progress in self.participants[participant].items():
            summary[treasure] = {
                "progress": progress,
                "discovered": progress >= len(self.treasures[treasure])
            }
        return summary
